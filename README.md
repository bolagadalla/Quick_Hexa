# Quick Hexa

My first published Unity game. You can find it on both the Google Play store and the App store. 

## What I learned:

	-[x] Creating Multiple screens
	-[x] Creating Custom buttons and custom functionality
	-[x] Learned how to use PlayerPrefs to store player settings
	-[x] Learned to create game difficulty
	-[x] Learned how to use IEnumerator
	-[x] Created Custom Audio Manager that would change the volume and pitch of audios. 
	     This gave every tap a different feeling everytime a player clicks on a tile.
	-[x] Created multiple levels and scenes.
	-[x] Worked with Unity ads to give the player a second chance once they watch an ad.
